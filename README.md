# Velvet Chrome — VS Code Theme

Velvet Chrome is a minimal dark theme that pairs a unified chrome frame with crisp cyan-violet accents and warm amber highlights. It's tuned for long sessions and clean syntax contrast across TypeScript, TSX, Python, SQL, Java, JSON, and Markdown.

## Highlights

- Unified, low-noise UI chrome with clear focus states.
- Split cyan-violet accents for structure and navigation.
- Warm gold for strings and important highlights.
- Muted green for comments and Git cues.
